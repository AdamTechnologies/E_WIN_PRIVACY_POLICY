                            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more speciﬁc purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing ("opt-out"), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.

                            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of ofﬁcial authority vested in the Owner; processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
        
                                <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the speciﬁc legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

                            <li>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore conﬁrm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.

                                <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period.</p>
        
                                <p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
        
                                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your veriﬁable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

            <li><strong>Purchasing Products and Credit</strong>
        
                <ol>
                    <li>Products can only be purchased using Credit - please follow the instructions provided on the Online Services or Kiosk. You will not receive your purchased Product, instead, it will be donated to the needy via our community partners. Please ensure that You have checked Your purchase carefully before submitting it. All purchases of Products are final with no cancellation options.</li>
                    <li>To purchase Credit and/or a Product on the Online Services, you must have an Account and a valid debit or credit card. To purchase Credit and/or a Product via a Kiosk or In-Store Services, you must have an Account and a valid debit, credit, pre-paid card, or cash. The Platform or retail assistant (for In-Store Services) will guide You through the purchase process, where you will be able to indicate the amount of Credit and/or Products you wish to purchase (noting that the price includes VAT). Please ensure that You have checked the amount of Credit or number of Products You are purchasing carefully before submitting it. All purchases of Credit and/or Products are final with no cancellation options. You may not request a refund merely because You have changed Your mind.</li>
                    <li>When purchasing Credit and/or a Product using the Online Services, you will be directed one of Our secure payment providers. Note that “EWIN LLC” will be the merchant listed on your bank or credit card statement. You can purchase Credit and/or a Product at any time.</li>
                    <li>Credit is denominated in AED, however, when purchasing Credit and/or a Product using a non- UAE debit or credit card the final price You pay will be calculated in accordance with the applicable exchange rate at the time Your card issuer processes the transaction. Please note that we do not have any control over how much Your card issuer may charge for such transactions.</li>
                    <li>Where Your purchase of Credit is successful, the value will be credited and will appear in Your Credit Balance. Once reflected in Your Credit Balance, Your Credit is available for immediate use.</li>
                    <li>No part of the Platform constitutes a contractual offer capable of acceptance. Your order for Credit constitutes a contractual offer that We may, at Our sole discretion, accept. Our acceptance is indicated by Us sending You an order confirmation by in-Account message, email and/or SMS. Only once We have sent You the confirmation will there be a legally binding Contract between Us and You.</li>
                    <li>There is no general right for a person to purchase Credit and/or Products. We may reject an order for, without limitation, the following reasons:
        
                        <ol start="1" type="a">
                            <li>where Our payment providers cannot obtain authorization for Your payment.</li>
                            <li>if Your purchase of Credit or Products otherwise breaches these Terms.</li>
                            <li>We suspect that the order has been placed fraudulently or infringes any law or regulation; or</li>
                            <li>We, in our sole discretion, deem it necessary. In the event that We reject a purchase of Credit and/or of a Product, we will contact You to confirm this and any payment made will be refunded to You as soon as possible. Any refunds due under this Clause 4.7 will be made using the same payment method that You used when purchasing Credit or a Product.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Credit cannot be transferred from Your Credit Balance to Your Winnings Balance nor between Accounts.</li>

            <li><strong>Transfer and Withdrawal of Prizes</strong>
        
                <ol>
                    <li>All Prizes will be paid in United Arab Emirates Dirhams (AED) and will be credited and appear in Your Winnings Balance following validation in accordance with Our validation procedures.</li>
                    <li>You can request to withdraw and/or transfer (to Your Credit Balance) Prizes credited to Your Winnings Balance subject to our Minimum Withdrawal Amount.</li>
                    <li>Except where restrictions on withdrawal apply (such as Minimum Withdrawal Amount, verification and security checks) You may withdraw or transfer Prizes from Your Winnings Balance at any time; You must, however, do so within the Withdrawal Period. Any Prize not withdrawn or transferred to Your Credit Balance before the end of the relevant Withdrawal Period will be forfeited and given to the Department of Economic Development.</li>
                    <li>Each request to transfer and/or withdraw Prizes must use the total available funds in Your Winnings Balance at the time the request is made. For example, you have a Winnings Balance total of AED 105, You may: (a) transfer it all to Your Credit Balance; (b) transfer part to Your Credit Balance and withdraw the rest; or (c) withdraw the entire amount. Note that any amount not withdrawn will automatically be transferred to Your Credit Balance (e.g., if You withdraw AED 100, then AED 5 will automatically be transferred to Your Credit Balance).</li>
                    <li>All transfers from the Winnings Balance will be to Your Credit Balance. Upon transfer, the transferred funds will automatically be used to purchase and add Credit – all transfers to the Credit Balance are final with no cancellation options. You may not request a reversal of the transfer or a refund merely because You have changed Your mind.</li>
                    <li>All withdrawals will be via bank wire transfer or authorized Financial Institution.</li>
                    <li>Withdrawal requests will be subject to any relevant security checks and withdrawal rules in place at the time of processing, including, but not limited to, applicable fees and any additional verification checks.</li>
                    <li>Withdrawal requests for an amount more than AED 36 but less than AED 200 are subject to a withdrawal fee of AED 10 (for withdrawals sent to an authorized Financial Institution in the UAE) or AED 20 (for withdrawals to authorized Financial Institutions outside of the UAE). Withdrawals for AED 200 and over are free of charge. Fees and charges are subject to change and will be applied at the time the withdrawal is requested.</li>
                    <li>An administration charge (or currency equivalent) may be levied on withdrawals at authorized Financial Institutions outside of the UAE and We will not be liable for any additional administration charges (including but not limited to foreign exchange charges) incurred as a direct result of such overseas withdrawal.</li>
                    <li>Prizes cannot be transferred between Accounts.</li>
                    <li>Please be advised that we are unable to make any payments by cheque, postal order, or similar.</li>
                    <li>We keep all funds in the Winnings Balance in a separate dedicated account which is routinely audited. This dedicated account is independent and is not comingled with the Manager’s other operating funds. In the case of insolvency, these funds would not be protected.</li>
                    <li>If funds are mistakenly credited to Your Winnings Balance, we are entitled to make the appropriate adjustment to it. If You transfer the funds mistakenly credited to Your Winnings Balance to Your Credit Balance and Enter a Draw, we reserve the right to void all such Entries and reverse any Prizes attributed to such Entries at Our discretion. If You withdraw funds mistakenly credited to Your Winnings Balance, You must reimburse Us on request, and We are entitled to set-off any subsequent purchase of Credit and/or Products to satisfy this liability.</li>

                    <li>From time to time, we may make promotional offers (“Promotions”) and conduct marketing competitions ("Competitions").</li>
                    <li>Each Promotion or Competition may have its set of specifically defined participation criteria and mechanics, the terms of which will be detailed within the Promotions page on Our website (‘Specific Terms”). The Promotions may also be communicated via advertisements and public relations across all digital and offline mediums.. The Promotions will be periodical in nature, of specific duration with fixed start and end dates.</li>
                    <li>Promotions and Competitions are open only to those who meet the eligibility criteria detailed in Rule 2.3. of the Rules and any eligibility requirements detailed in the Specific Terms.</li>

                            <li>If We suspect that an individual has set up a fake email address and/or social media page to circumvent Promotion/Competition Terms, We reserve the right to disqualify all entries that we reasonably believe were generated by that individual.</li>
                            <li>You accept any Competition or Promotion prize (“Competition or Promotion Prize’) We award to You entirely at Your own risk and We are not liable for any adverse consequence You experience because of Your acceptance and/or use of the Competition or Promotion Prize.</li>
                            <li>All Competition or Promotion Prizes are personal, non-transferable, non-exchangeable and are not redeemable for cash or any other prize.</li>
                            <li>Where the Competition or Promotion Prize is Credit, the winner must create an Account in order to receive such Competition or Promotion Prize.</li>
                            <li>We reserve the right (when reasonably required to do so) to replace the stated Competition or Promotion Prizes with prizes that We consider to be of broadly equivalent value.

                            <li>All rights in relation to a Competition or Promotion and Your involvement in it vest exclusively in Us.</li>
                            <li>If we become aware of any fraud, dishonesty or similar action (or omission) by You which relates to Your entitlement to a Competition or Promotion Prize, we (in Our sole discretion) retain the right to disqualify You and not award You the Competition or Promotion Prize. If the fraud, deceit or similar act is only discovered after the Competition or Promotion Prize has been awarded to You, you must immediately return it (or provide equivalent compensation) to Us after We notify You. We may also deduct any Credit awarded as a Competition or Promotion Prize from Your Credit Balance.</li>
                            <li>We may disqualify You if We, in Our sole discretion, believe that You are in breach of the Promotion/Competition Terms or if You otherwise conduct Yourself in a manner which is inappropriate in the circumstances.</li>
                            <li>You are disqualified from receiving any Competition or Promotion Prize which, for any reason, you would not be allowed to receive or use by law or where Our award of the Competition or Promotion Prize to You would be unlawful.</li>
                            <li>We reserve the right, at any time, and from time to time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any Competition or Promotion, including the Promotion/Competition Terms with or without prior notice for any reasons without Us having any liability to You.</li>

Where You have mistakenly received Credit as a Competition or Promotion Prize, we may deduct this from Your Credit Balance.</li>
                            <li>Entries received after the relevant advertised closing date for a Competition or Promotion will not be accepted.</li>
                            <li>We will notify Competition or Promotion Prize winners within five (5) working days of the end date of each Competition. Your failure to claim a Competition or Promotion Prize within seven (7) days of Your notification disqualifies your entitlement to receive it and the Competition or Promotion Prize will be forfeit. We may select another winner for the Competition or Promotion Prize.</li>
                            <li>Our decision is final and conclusive in all circumstances and no correspondence will be entered into.</li>
                            <li>We reserve the right to request proof of a Competition or Promotion Prize winner's identity in the form of a passport or national identification document. In the event that a Competition or Promotion Prize winner cannot provide us with proof of identity that is reasonably acceptable to us, we may withdraw the Competition or Promotion Prize and select another Competition or Promotion winner.</li>
